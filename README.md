# Energy Forecasting & Pipelining System – Hackathon Project

This project was developed during a hackathon with the goal of predicting the creation and usage of energy from multiple renewable and non-renewable sources, and optimizing the pipeline of energy flow based on real-time sensor inputs from different locations.

## 🔧 Problem Statement

To build a smart energy monitoring and forecasting system that:
- Predicts energy production and consumption across distributed sources
- Automates decisions on energy routing from source to destination
- Improves energy efficiency using predictive analytics and sensor data

## 🌍 Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing and predictive modeling
- **Arduino/ESP32** with various **sensors** (e.g., current/voltage, solar input) for real-time data collection
- **Flask/Express** for backend API
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** for visualizations
- **Machine Learning** algorithms for usage prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM prototype)
- **IoT integration** to simulate sensor data across locations

## 🚀 My Role
- Developed the machine learning pipeline for forecasting energy production and consumption
- Handled data preprocessing and normalization from multiple sensor nodes
- Designed system architecture for pipelining energy based on source availability
- Built data visualizations to represent energy trends and predictions
